<h1>About Me!</h1> <! –– I made an extra line break because I thought it would make reading it better. I'll edit this later ––> <br>

Here are a few things about me. I am a student at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uri.edu"> University of Rhode Island. </a> <br>
<br>
I am a freshman here at URI, I am double majoring in Computer Science and German. I love learning new things about computers. <br>
<br>
I think I will love learning about coding because I've coded before such as learning the basics of C/C++. <br>
<br>
Ever since elementary school up until high school, I've played around with block coding, code.org, scratch, etc. <br>
<br>
I've always wanted to create video games and recently in my last two years of high school, my passion for coding came back to me. <br>
