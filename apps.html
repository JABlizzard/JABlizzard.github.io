	  <h2><strong>Brick Breakers</strong></h2>
            <p> This game was inspired from a game called Breakout. <br>

<br> You must press start, then you must use the left and right arrow keys to move left and right. <br>

<br> Similar to Pong, you must use a paddle to reflect back the ball and it must bounce and break all the bricks within the gamespace. <br>

<br>As I have mentioned above, you must use the paddle to bounce the ball around and the ball will collide with the top, left and right walls to keep bouncing. <br>

<br>Be careful and always hit the ball back when it goes back down, you have limited lives. <br>

<br>You are given 3 lives and you must not let the ball get pass the paddle or you will lost a life and it would respawn the ball back to the middle. <br>
<br>Once it respawns, be ready to reflect back the ball towards the bricks. Once you get all 28 bricks, you win and the time it took you to get all bricks broken is shown at the end!<br>
		    <br> You must try to beat other people's best time! Enjoy, good luck and have fun!!!<br>
