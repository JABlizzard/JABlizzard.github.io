<h1>Welcome To JABlizzard's Programming Portfolio</h1>

My name is <em><strong>Judd Lizarda</strong></em>.<br>
This is a website I made showing the programs that I wrote in my CSC106 course at the University of Rhode Island. <br>
I have here a code that I've relearned about HTML at Khan Academy. <br>
I've learned to format the text and also the visuals of a webpage. <br>
The buttons above will take you to another page about me. My story with coding or how I got back into coding after a few years break away from it <br>
Another page is labeled, "Javascript" and it will have the coding projects that I will have this semester. <br>
